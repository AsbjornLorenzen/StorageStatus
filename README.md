# StorageStatus
A tool for managing the storage in a factory.
The individual components are listed in the storage. When the components are used in a device, the device stores information about the components origin through an assigned LOT number. This gives every device to have a complete list of parts that can be traced back to the origin.
The components and devices are viewed and edited in a flask website. 
The project uses Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite.
To setup, enter your the component names in the components.txt, and run the setup() command to create a database.
